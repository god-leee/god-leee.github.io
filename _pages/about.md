Hi, I am currently a first-year master student majoring in Computer Science at UC San Diego. I obtained my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from Sichuan University, where I was advised by Prof. [Yingjie Zhou](https://yj-zhou.github.io/). I also spent a semester in NUS for my undergraduate thesis supervised by Prof. [Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/). 

Research Interest
======
I am interested in learning representations for graph data. My current research lies in understanding, expressiveness, and deep architectures for Graph Neural Networks. I am also generally interested in data mining related systems, algorithms and applications.

News
=====
I am seeking research opportunities or interns in Summer 2022.
I am also looking for PhD positions starting from Fall 2023 (or Spring).
